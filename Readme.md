# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects (freeCodeCamp)

This repository contains machine learning projects completed as part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum. Each notebook demonstrates a different ML technique, including recommendation systems, regression modeling, and natural language processing (NLP).

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 1. 📚 Book Recommendation System with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
**Notebook:** [`fcc_book_recommendation_knn.ipynb`](https://github.com/sarbagyaneu123/ML_Projects/blob/master/fcc_book_recommendation_knn.ipynb)

A content-based recommendation engine built using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. It suggests books to users based on similarity scores derived from user-book rating patterns.

- 🔧 Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`
- 🧠 Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors
- 📌 Key Concepts: Sparse matrix creation, cosine similarity, recommender logic

### 2. 🏥 Predict Medical Insurance Costs using Regression
**Notebook:** [`fcc_predict_health_costs_with_regression.ipynb`](https://github.com/sarbagyaneu123/ML_Projects/blob/master/fcc_predict_health_costs_with_regression.ipynb)

This project applies linear regression to predict individual healthcare insurance costs based on factors like age, BMI, smoking status, and region.

- 🔧 Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
- 🧠 Algorithm: Linear Regression
- 📌 Key Concepts: Feature engineering, correlation analysis, model evaluation

### 3. 📱 SMS Text Classification with NLP
**Notebook:** [`fcc_sms_text_classification.ipynb`](https://github.com/sarbagyaneu123/ML_Projects/blob/master/fcc_sms_text_classification.ipynb)

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project to classify SMS messages as spam or ham using vectorization and machine learning classifiers.

- 🔧 Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`
- 🧠 Algorithms: Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression
- 📌 Key Concepts: Text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, classification metrics
